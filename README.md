# Demonstrations
This repo contains a lot of my school work and showcases my progression as a programmer. 
As a brief overview, I will be graduating Computer Engineering Technology (CNT) from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) in April 2026.
CNT aims to teach students about designing and developing systems to collect data from the physical world using microcontrollers and sensors, then storing that data in a database and displaying it in a user interface either with a web or windows application.
The broad topics I learn in this program include, but not limited to:
- Full-Stack Web Development
- Full-Stack Windows Application Development
- Embedded Systems Development
- PCB and Hardware Electronics Development
- Databases
## Specific Skills
Specific things I have learned in CNT include but not limited to:
- Memory Management, Data Structures, Sorting Algorithms 
- Object Oriented Programming (C#)
- Databases (mySQL and SQL Server)
- Front-End Languages (HTML/CSS/Javascript (jQuery))
- Back-End Lanaguages (Javascript (jQuery), PHP, C# (ASP.NET - ADO & Entity))
- REST API Development
- Microcontroller Design
- Electronics and Embedded Systems Design
- Embedded Programming (C)
